        <p>My favorite hobby is reading. Whenever I am free I read books. My favorite series of books is Harry Potter. There are so many types or genres of books. They are fiction, non-fiction, fantasy, realistic-fiction, historical-fiction, mythology, fairy tales, folk-tales, biographies, auto-biographies, etc. My favorite genre is fantasy, whech involves magic, magical creatures, etc. Reading is helpful to us, both physically and mentally. It helps increase vocabulary and comprehension, reduces stress, helps in falling asleep quickly, lowers blood pressure, fights depression, and more. And overall, reading helps us become a stonger and better person.</p>
